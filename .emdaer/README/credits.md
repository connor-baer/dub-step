[Kent Dodds'](github.com/kentcdodds) work on [downshift 🏎](https://github.com/paypal/downshift/) heavily inspired this package. You may even notice some copy pasta in the README 😏.

This package is also inspired by work I rubber-ducked with [flip](https://github.com/flipactual/) for managing focus in a TV Shelf UI.

Much of the swipe code was lifted from [react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick/) by [akiran](https://github.com/akiran) a very solid solution for swipe friendly carousels.

There is no lack of carousel libraries out there. I looked at many of them while writting this package. I hope dub-step represents a move towards an unopinionated solution that enables design and development to work together not against each other.

Check out other solutions on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=carousel%20swipe%20react&page=1&ranking=optimal).

Some of the time spent writting this package was sponsored by [Four Kitchens](https://www.fourkitchens.com/). I ❤️ 4K. Come [work with us](https://www.fourkitchens.com/careers/)!
